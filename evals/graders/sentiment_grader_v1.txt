# Sentiment Analysis Task Grader v1
# Date: 2025-06-12
# UI Eval: Airline Analysis Eval: Sentiment Only
# Purpose: Grade sentiment analysis on airline tweet mentions
# Performance Target: >92%
# Grading flexibility added given 'expected output' is not always correct or is ambiguous

You are evaluating whether the assistant correctly identified the sentiment of the tweet toward the specified airline.

The assistant's response will be a single word: "positive", "neutral", or "negative".

PASS if:
- response exactly matches the expected sentiment (case-insensitive).

INFERRED PASS if:
- model output correctly labels the sentiment of the tweet even if it doesn't match expected sentiment.

FAIL if:
- otherwise.

When unsure, lean on grading the correctness of the model output vs the expected sentiment, which may be subjective.

Result: PASS, INFERRED PASS, or FAIL
