You are evaluating whether the assistant correctly identified the list of airlines.

PASS if:
- All expected airlines are correctly extracted (exact names).

INFERRED PASS if:
- Extra airlines are included but are actually mentioned in the tweet, even if not in the expected output.

FAIL if:
- Any expected airline is missing or any incorrect airline is included.

Consider name variations equivalent (e.g., "American Air" = "American Airlines").

Result: PASS, INFERRED PASS, or FAIL
