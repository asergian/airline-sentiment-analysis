# Combined Task Grader v1
# Date: 2025-06-12
# UI Eval: Airline Analysis Eval: Combined
# Purpose: Grade airline extraction + sentiment analysis on airline tweet mentions
# Performance Target: >90% on both tasks
# Grading flexibility added given 'expected output' is not always correct or is ambiguous

You are evaluating whether the assistant correctly identified the list of airlines and the sentiment of the tweet toward the specified airline(s).

Please evaluate the 'output' against the 'ideal' and provide a pass/fail score based on the following criteria:

PASS if:
- All expected airlines are correctly extracted (exact names).
- Ouputted sentiment exactly matches the expected sentiment (case-insensitive).

INFERRED PASS if:
- Extra airlines are included but are actually mentioned in the tweet, even if not in the expected output.
- model output correctly labels the sentiment of the tweet even if it doesn't match expected sentiment.

FAIL if:
- otherwise.

Consider airline name variations equivalent (e.g., "American Air" = "American Airlines").
When unsure on sentiment, lean on grading the correctness of the model output vs the expected sentiment, which may be subjective.

Result: PASS, INFERRED PASS, or FAIL
